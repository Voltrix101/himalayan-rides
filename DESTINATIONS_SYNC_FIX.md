# 🔄 Real-time Sync Fix for Must-Visit Destinations

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed:**

The admin panel's "Must-Visit Destinations" page was using `destinationsService` (collection: `destinations`) while the test data was being added to `explorePlans` collection via `explorePlansService`.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

1. **Updated DestinationsPage.tsx** to use `explorePlansService` instead of `destinationsService`
2. **Added real-time subscription** for immediate sync with test data
3. **Proper collection matching** between test data and admin panel

## 🧪 **Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Verify Real-time Sync**
1. Go to admin dashboard → **Must-Visit Destinations** page
2. Should show: "🔄 Real-time sync active" indicator
3. Console should log: "🏔️ Setting up real-time subscription for explore plans in admin panel"

### **Step 2: Test Data Addition**
1. Go to admin dashboard → **Home** (Dashboard)
2. Click **"Add Test Destinations"** button
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - ✅ Test destinations appear on main page "Explore" immediately
   - ✅ Test destinations appear in admin "Must-Visit Destinations" page immediately
   - ✅ Real-time sync works both ways

### **Step 3: Verify Data Display**
Admin "Must-Visit Destinations" should show:
- **Pangong Lake** (Easy, 2 days, ₹10,000)
- **Nubra Valley Desert Safari** (Moderate, 3 days, ₹12,000) 
- **Tso Moriri Lake Expedition** (Challenging, 4 days, ₹15,000)

## 🔍 **Console Verification:**

Look for these console messages:
```
🏔️ Setting up real-time subscription for explore plans in admin panel
📍 Admin destinations received: 3 explore plans
explorePlansService.ts:36 Explore plans loaded: 6
```

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ **Main Page**: Shows all explore plans in "Explore" section
- ✅ **Admin Panel**: Shows same explore plans in "Must-Visit Destinations" 
- ✅ **Real-time Sync**: Changes reflect immediately on both pages
- ✅ **Collection Consistency**: Both use `explorePlans` collection

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

**Before:**
- Main page: Uses `explorePlansService` → `explorePlans` collection ✅
- Admin page: Uses `destinationsService` → `destinations` collection ❌

**After:**
- Main page: Uses `explorePlansService` → `explorePlans` collection ✅  
- Admin page: Uses `explorePlansService` → `explorePlans` collection ✅

**Test now: Add test destinations and verify they appear in both main page and admin panel immediately!** 🎯
